This project aims to demonstrate capabilities and limitations of compressive sensing in a very basic set up analysing sinusoidal signals 
The code provides functions to construct the framework for analysis and there are some examplar investigations to compare how different variabled affect error, such as the kind of matrix used,and the level of compression.
